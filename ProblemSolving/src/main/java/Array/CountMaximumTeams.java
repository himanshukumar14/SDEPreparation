/**
 * 
 * Amazon is hosting a team hackathon.
 * 
 * Each team will have exactly teamSize developers. A developerï¿½s skill level is
 * denoted by skill[i]. The difference between the maximum and minimum skill
 * levels within a team cannot exceed a threshold, maxDiff. Determine the
 * maximum number of teams that can be formed from the contestants. Example
 * skill = [3, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5] team5ize = 3 maxDiff = 2
 * 
 * At most, 2 teams can be formed: [3, 3, 1] and [4, 6, 5]. The difference
 * between the maximum and minimum skill levels is 2 in each case, which does
 * not exceed the threshold value oft.
 * 
 * Function Description Complete the function countMaximumTeams in the editor
 * below.
 * 
 * countMaximumTeams has the following parameter(s):
 * 
 * int skill[n]: the developers skill levels int teamSize: the number of
 * developers to make up a team int maxDiff: the threshold value Returns:
 * 
 * int: the maximum number of teams that can be formed at one time
