ELK (ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack is used for the logging system

E = Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine built on Apache Lucene. Support for various languages, high performance,
and schema-free JSON documents makes Elasticsearch an ideal choice for various log analytics and search use cases.

On January 21, 2021, Elastic NV announced that they would change their software licensing strategy and
not release new versions of Elasticsearch and Kibana under the permissive Apache License, Version 2.0 (ALv2) license.
Instead, new versions of the software will be offered under the Elastic license, with source code available under the Elastic License or SSPL.
These licenses are not open source and do not offer users the same freedoms. For a secure, high-quality, fully open source search and analytics suite,
you can use the OpenSearch project, a community-driven, ALv2 licensed fork of open source Elasticsearch and Kibana.

You can send data in the form of JSON documents to Elasticsearch using the API or ingestion tools such as Logstash and Amazon Kinesis Firehose.
Elasticsearch automatically stores the original document and adds a searchable reference to the document in the clusterâ€™s index.
You can then search and retrieve the document using the Elasticsearch API. You can also use Kibana,
a visualization tool, with Elasticsearch to visualize your data and build interactive dashboards.

L = Logstash
Logstash is an open-source data ingestion tool that allows you to collect data from a variety of sources, transform it, and send it to your desired destination.
With pre-built filters and support for over 200 plugins, Logstash allows users to easily ingest data regardless of the data source or type.
Logstash is a light-weight, open-source, server-side data processing pipeline that allows you to collect data from a variety of sources, transform it on the fly,
and send it to your desired destination. It is most often used as a data pipeline for Elasticsearch, an open-source analytics and search engine.
Because of its tight integration with Elasticsearch, powerful log processing capabilities, and over 200 pre-built open-source plugins that can help
you easily index your data, Logstash is a popular choice for loading data into Elasticsearch.

K = Kibana
Kibana is a data visualization and exploration tool used for log and time-series analytics, application monitoring,
and operational intelligence use cases. It offers powerful and easy-to-use features such as histograms,
line graphs, pie charts, heat maps, and built-in geospatial support. Also, it provides tight integration with Elasticsearch,
a popular analytics and search engine, which makes Kibana the default choice for visualizing data stored in Elasticsearch.
